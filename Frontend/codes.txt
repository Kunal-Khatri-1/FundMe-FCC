// wallet extentions inject web3 objects into window object like ethereum and solana
// window.ethererum and window.solana

// wallets are important because
// underneath the hood they are connected to them
// in order to connect with blockchain we always need a node
// Alchemy/Infura => third party blockchains that you can interact with
// need them to create a provider or a node to send transactions to
// see in metamask all the testnet and mainnet have RPC URL with Infura
